        HIV is a fragile virus that doesn't survive outside the body for long. It can't be transmitted through sweat, urine, or saliva. 
        If HIV is controlled, the risk of transmission is close to zero.<br><br><b> There are powerful tools to help prevent HIV transmission, including: </b>
        
            <li>Using a new condom correctly every time you have sex.</li>
        
        <li>Taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a combination of HIV drugs taken before potential exposure to HIV.</li>
        <li>Taking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), medication taken after an exposure to prevent getting HIV.</li></p><br><br>
